Operating System Principle Assignment 2, Semester 2 2017

## Test environment I've remembered

Should be Deepin Linux with Linux kernel v4.9 and/or Debian 9 as I was using these two distros at that time.

## What this assignment do

Implements a simple kernel module and a modified device driver. In my scenario I've done a key logger which logs user input to a memory buffer with USB keyboard.
